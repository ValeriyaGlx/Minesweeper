# Minesweeper ðŸ’£
:point_right: DESCRIPTION:  The Final Project **RS School Stage1 course**
Welcome to the description of my Minesweeper Recreation project, a part of the Final Project for the RS School Stage 1 course. In this project, I have meticulously recreated the classic Minesweeper game using clean and efficient JavaScript code. 


:page_facing_up: INSTUCTION: 
- Full copy of the same name game on clean Java Script    
- My project faithfully recreates the original Minesweeper gameplay. Players are tasked with uncovering tiles on a grid, with the goal of revealing all non-mine tiles without triggering any mines.
- I've designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows players to easily navigate the game, interact with tiles, and keep track of their progress. 
- Players can choose from different grid sizes and mine densities to tailor the game's difficulty to their preference. This adds an element of challenge and variety to the gaming experience.  
- To aid players in solving the puzzle, we've implemented the ability to flag potential mine locations and utilize chord-clicking for quicker tile reveals when adjacent tiles are already cleared.
- Upon successful completion, players are treated to a victory animation, and in the case of triggering a mine, an explosion animation conveys the unfortunate outcome. 
- I've incorporated a timer to challenge players to complete the game in the shortest time possible.  
- Responsive Design.
